                </p>
                <p>The primary culprit here is <i>notetaking</i>.</p>
                <p>The widely accepted gold standard for learning nowadays is to sit in a lecture or class, and
                    transcribe or <i>note take</i> as much of what is spoken by the tutor in the belief that this will
                    sear the information into our minds for world until end. </p>
                <p>The reality of this practice is that we disengage with the class as we mindlessly recreate a lesser
                    set of notes that are likely already available, diminishing the effectiveness of the class in favor
                    for later teaching ourselves a concept based on self-created material that could very well have been
                    transcribed incorrectly.</p>

                <p><b class="bolder">Effortless lear</b>ning begins with understanding.</p>
                <p>The first step in a <i class="">three step strategy</i>,
                    deep understanding is the core foundation to long term memory as it creates a web of neural activity
                    in the brain.</p>
                <p>When we follow the traditional methods of memorization based on a process of wrote-learning; this is
                    analogous to creating a singular knowledge node in our brains neural network.</p>
                <p>Learning without understanding is how we create these standalone knowledge neurons, and their
                    strength and our ability to recall them is heavily dependant on how fresh the material is in our
                    head. As time passes, the node fades into oblivion and we forget.</p>
                <p>Instead, if we prioritise first understanding a concept, our brain creates a web of knowledge, a web
                    of related information, a conglomerate of knowledge nodes strung together into comprehensive
                    understanding. Nodes
                    tangled in this web are far less suceptible to fading as the strength of the node comes from the
                    strength of the web.</p>
                <p>We can think about it as trying to forget one specific day in our life, which is very easy, versus
                    trying to forget an entire year of our life; much much harder.</p>

                    arduous long hours spent trying to brand a concept into your brain, then you need to <b
                        class="bolder">engage</b>.</p>
                <p><i>But what does effective engagement actually look like?</i></p>
                <p>Effective engagement is the process of intaking new information and seeing whether or not this new
                    information is in alignment with your current model of understanding. </p>
                <p>You need to analyse and evaluate new information presented to you which is an active process, and
                    when done properly one of two things happens.</p>
                <p><i>1. The new information aligns with your current conceptual understand and can be added to your web
                        of understanding.</i></p>
                <p><i>2. The new information has a merge conflict with your current conceptual understanding.</i></p>
                <p>This second step is <b>critical</b>, and if you are distracted whilst taking notes or with some facet
                    of life, you will miss out on this critical moment.</p>
                <p>When something doesn't add up per step 2, it is essential that you question and challenge. This is
                    not to tell someone that they are wrong, but instead to explain your current understanding and the
                    reasons it might not add up. Then let the teacher bridge the gaps in your understanding and help
                    evolve
                    you to this greater perspective of big picture understanding.</p>

                <p><b class="bolder">We have now arr</b>ived at the start of <b class="bolder">phase 2</b>. In the first
                    phase, we mastered the art of understanding, and it is now time we test our new found knowledge to
                    expose any potential vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p>We achieve this via a process known as adaptation where we apply our understanding to problems in a
                    new environment or circumstance.</p>
                <p>Often we will find that our current model of understanding was not as complete and comprehensive as
                    we initially thought, yet this is valuable feedback for us.</p>
                <p>When a gap in our knowledge and understanding is exposed, we can research and critically analyse the
                    information need to patch up our web of understanding until it is so intricately woven that not even
                    water seeps through.</p>
                <p>Working for this information so to further our understanding also helps to create a sense of
                    engagement
                    and our brain is more likely to prioritise it, consolidating it in our mind; we worked hard for it.

                    <b class="bolder"> Immortalizing</b>.
                </p>
                <p>I know at the start of this guide, we agreed to relinquish our need to notetake, instead to
                    prioritise our
                    engagement and future understanding of a topic. And while notetaking should not be used as a means
                    for understanding, it can be useful to reinforce the concept in our mind, immortalizing our
                    understanding, our brain's web of knowing for world until end.</p>
                <p>Only once we have a complete understanding, tried and tested via a process of application and
                    adaptation, can we now summarize what we have learning in a set of notes, where these notes can
                    likely be written from memory.</p>
                <p>Chances are at this point, you would even feel comfortable explaining complex concepts related to the
                    subject in a simple and clear manner to someone with no prior knowledge or exposure to the topic.
                </p>
                <p><i>And it is in this vein that our notes should be written.</i></p>
                <p>This process is the final stepping stone to enternal understanding and while the notes are not
                    created with the intent of being viewed again, on the odd chance some one hundred years later that
                    you might
                    need a refresher course, your younger self has you covered!</p>
